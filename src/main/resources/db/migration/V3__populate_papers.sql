('Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Permissioned Blockchains', 'Alice Smith, John Doe', 'As decentralized systems transition from public to private sectors, the need for scalable consensus mechanisms grows. This paper introduces a sharded Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol that achieves 50,000 transactions per second under 30% node failure scenarios. We provide a rigorous mathematical proof of safety and liveness.', '/files/cs/blockchain_scalability_final.pdf', 1, '2024-02-14', FALSE, NOW(), NOW()),

('Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthetic Financial Data', 'Carol Johnson, Mark Specter', 'The scarcity of labeled financial data remains a bottleneck for machine learning in fintech. This research proposes "FinGAN," a generative model capable of synthesizing realistic stock market volatility patterns while strictly adhering to privacy-preserving constraints. Our results show that models trained on FinGAN data perform within 2% accuracy of those trained on real-world datasets.', '/files/cs/fin_gan_v2.pdf', 2, '2025-01-10', FALSE, NOW(), NOW()),

('Human-Computer Interaction in Virtual Reality Surgical Simulators', 'Emma Turner, Sarah Vance', 'This study investigates the tactile feedback latency thresholds for surgeons using VR tools. By testing 50 resident surgeons, we identified that latencies above 15ms significantly degrade the precision of arterial suturing. We propose a predictive haptic rendering algorithm to mask network jitter.', '/files/cs/vr_surgery_haptics.pdf', 4, '2024-09-12', FALSE, NOW(), NOW());
